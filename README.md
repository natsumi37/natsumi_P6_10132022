✅Project Summary<br>
Project 6: Build a Secure API for a Review App<br>
Scenario:<br>
Last week, you received a message on your freelance account from Piiquante, a specialty maker of spicy, pepper-based condiments, asking for help with a new project. With the increasing popularity of specialty hot sauces thanks to the YouTube series "Hot Ones," Piiquante wants to develop a hot sauce review web app called "Hot Takes."<br>
While the product manager at Piiquante eventually wants to transform the review app into an online store, she wants the first version to be a gallery that allows users to upload their favorite hot sauces and like/dislike ones that others share. The app’s front end has been developed using Angular and has been precompiled after internal testing, but Piiquante needs a back-end developer to build the API.<br>
